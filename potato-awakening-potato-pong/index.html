<div class="box"> <h2>What is a potato?</h2>  <p>A potato is a starchy plant tuber that is the third most important food crop in the world, cooked and eaten as a vegetable. There are more than 4,000 varieties of native potatoes, mostly found in the Andes. They come in many sizes and shapes. There are also over 180 wild potato species. Though they are too bitter to eat, their important biodiversity includes natural resistances to pests, diseases, and climatic conditions.  </p></div>

<div class="flex-container1">
  <div class="flex-item1"><div id="type">Starchy</div><br> Like the classic Idaho or Russet, these potatoes are (obviously) high in starch and low in moisture. They’re fluffy, making them great for boiling, baking and frying, but they don’t hold their shape well, so they should be avoided in dishes like casseroles, gratins and potato salads.</div>
  <div class="flex-item1"><div id="type">Waxy</div><br> Like Red Bliss or New Potatoes, these have a low starch content and are often characterized by a creamy, firm and moist flesh that holds its shape well after cooking. They’re typically great for roasting, boiling, casseroles and potato salads.</div>
  <div class="flex-item1"><div id="type">All-Purpose</div><br> These potatoes have a medium starch content that fall somewhere in between the starchy and waxy potatoes. They’re a true multi-purpose potato, and therefore can be used for just about any cooking application. A classic example is the Yukon Gold.</div>

    <div class="desc">Idaho Russet potatoes are russet-skinned with white flesh. They’re what we typically imagine when we think of potatoes.

They’re also very absorbent, so are great paired with butter and cream — think mashed potatoes. Just don’t try using Idaho Russets for potato salads, gratins or any dish that requires the potatoes to hold their shape.</div>
